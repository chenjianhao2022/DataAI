# DataAI
DataAI is a Python-based project that combines data analysis and artificial intelligence techniques. It provides a framework and tools to analyze and extract insights from data using AI algorithms, enabling users to make data-driven decisions and predictions. The project aims to simplify the process of applying AI techniques to various data analysis tasks.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: Perform data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering to prepare the data for analysis.
- Machine learning: Apply machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and other tasks.
- Deep learning: Utilize deep neural networks for complex data analysis and pattern recognition.
- Predictive modeling: Build predictive models to make accurate predictions and forecasts based on historical data.
- Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of AI models using various metrics and techniques.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/chenjianhao2022/DataAI.git


2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Set up your environment:

- Prepare your data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, Excel, JSON) and place it in the `data` directory.
- Customize the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation code in the `dataai.py` file.

## Usage

1. Prepare your data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, Excel, JSON) and place it in the `data` directory.

2. Customize the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation code in the `dataai.py` file. Use Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn to perform data analysis and build AI models.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('data/data.csv')

# Preprocess the data
# ...

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the AI model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print('Accuracy:', accuracy)
Customize the code based on your specific data analysis and AI modeling requirements.

Run the dataai.py script to perform the data analysis and AI modeling tasks:

python dataai.py
The script will load the data, preprocess it, train an AI model, make predictions, and evaluate the model's performance.
